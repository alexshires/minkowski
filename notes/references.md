# Plan

## CMB data

* What datasets should we analyse?

## minkowski theory

* statistics of spots after a cut-off

## papers

## Plan

* State of play - what accuracy do we need to achieve?
* Methods to achieve this accuracy?
* What tests will prove the code works?
* How do we extract a statistical limit? In what cases can we do this?

# Core software

* Reproducible pipeline - Luigi? Sklearn?

## Data extraction and processing

* requirements - what preprocessing do we need to do?
* Caroline?

## MF calculation software

* core calculations - what's the best language/library/way to do this reliably
* DIY :)

## Statistical analysis

* is statsmodels good enough?
* better statistical packages

## Simulation

* what do we need to simulate? 
* core CMB + noise parameters + filtering software - before it goes into our preprocessing
* what scale of simulation do we need to do ?
* do we need to set this up for AWS Batch?
